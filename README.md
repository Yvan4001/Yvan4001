## 🚀 About Me
I am a developer driven by **performance, low-level architecture, and complex problem-solving**. My journey is defined by a **'Deep Dive' approach**: I tackle the most difficult challenges first to master the core principles of computing. 

As a **neuroatypical developer**, I leverage my "asynchronous brain" to process complex information through unique angles, allowing for high-level architectural oversight and creative debugging.

## 🌟 Key Achievements (Private Repositories)
*Since my core research and source codes are kept private, here is a summary of my architectural work:*

### 🧠 Game Theory & AI: Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe AI
* **The Challenge:** Developed a highly optimized AI for Tic-Tac-Toe specifically in **Java**, filling a gap where most resources only exist in Python.
* **Technicality:** Implementation of the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, optimized for the JVM environment.

### 🌌 Voxel-based Procedural Planet Renderer (Unity/C#)
* **The Challenge:** Creating infinite diverse worlds without manual assets.
* **Technicality:** Heavy use of Perlin Noise and cellular automata. Rewrote native Unity physics tools to handle procedural mesh collisions in real-time.

### 💻 FluxGridOS: Rust System Kernel
* **The Challenge:** Building an OS from scratch.
* **Technicality:** Developed an ASM Bootloader, a proprietary USB stack, and a custom Memory Management Unit (MMU) in **Rust (no_std)**.

### 🔐 Secure E-Commerce Core API (.NET 8)
* **The Challenge:** Massive refactoring of a legacy synchronous system into a fully asynchronous architecture (80+ files).
* **Security:** Implemented Double Submit Cookies, JWT rotation, and AES encryption for sensitive data.
